    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nWelcome! I’m Spancer Zhou, a Master’s student in Bioinformatics at Case Western Reserve University, where I am fortunate to work under the mentorship of Dr. Gurkan Bebek. With a passion for uncovering insights at the intersection of computational biology and neuroscience, I am currently focusing on multi-omics integration. My research involves analyzing RNA-seq data from 5xFAD mouse models (cortex and hippocampus tissues at 4, 8, and 12 months) alongside proteomics datasets. These efforts aim to uncover molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, which hold the potential to inform precision medicine strategies.\nPreviously, I graduated from Michigan State University with a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies, specializing in Environment and Health, where I honed my skills in computational and experimental biology. I’ve contributed to projects ranging from predictive modeling of cell surface protein abundance using scRNA-seq data to exploring deep learning techniques for understanding proteomic variability. These experiences have provided me with a strong foundation in data analysis, programming, and biological interpretation.\nAlthough I am in the early stages of my academic journey, I am committed to continuous growth and exploration. I plan to pursue a Ph.D. to deepen my expertise and contribute to the broader field of bioinformatics, with a long-term vision of advancing our understanding of complex biological systems.\nBeyond my academic pursuits, I’m an avid traveler who finds inspiration in road trips and exploring new landscapes. I believe that these experiences enrich my perspective and fuel creativity, both in research and in life.\nFeel free to reach out contact me to discuss collaboration opportunities, research interests, or simply to connect!\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "After reading *The American Statistician*, I realized how much our current approach to statistical analysis often misses the bigger picture. The article explains that relying too much on p-values, especially the cutoff of 0.05, has caused many problems in scientific research.\nWhat struck me most was the concept that, statistical significance has become a “tyrannical” binary rule rather than a helpful tool. The authors point out that, Fisher and other early statisticians never intended p-values to become the sole arbiter of scientific truth or importance. P-values were originally meant to suggest when results might be worth a closer look, not to serve as final proof. The authors’ message to “Accept uncertainty. Be thoughtful, open, and modest” (ATOM) really made sense to me as a better way to think about data.\nThis idea of embracing uncertainty feels especially relevant to my own experience. When I work with health data, the results are often unclear. Trying to make a clear yes/no decision based only on a p-value has always felt wrong, but I didn't know there was another way until I read this article.\nThe article also helped me understand how focusing on p &lt; 0.05 can lead to problems like p-hacking and selective reporting. I had learned about these issues before, but this paper helped me see how they are connected to the way we're trained to look for \"significant\" results.\nOne of my favorite quotes from the paper is:\n**“No single index should substitute for scientific reasoning.”**\nIn 2025, I want to be the kind of data scientist who doesn't just aim for small p-values. I want to explain results clearly, acknowledge uncertainty, and focus on what the data really show. This article gave me a better understanding—and a better mindset—for doing that."
